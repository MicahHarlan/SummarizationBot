# SummarizationBot
This project aims to address the need to simplify and accelerate the process of extracting valuable information from complex pieces of literature by using AI-powered text summarization techniques, making research more accessible and time-efficient. Solving this problem would decrease the amount of time it takes researchers to review and critically analyze research papers within their field of study, aiding in peer reviews, and the general study of complex research. Overall, this would make academic journals (Along with any other category of literature the user wishes to summarize) more accessible for students, researchers, and the general public.
